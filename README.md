# Smart Garbage Monitoring System Using IoT

An IoT-based solution to enable smart and efficient waste management for urban environments. This system was built as a final-year B.Tech project.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time garbage level detection
- Automatic lid control using IR sensor and servo motor
- Fire hazard detection via flame sensor
- Metal detection to block hazardous waste
- Alerts via IoT platform (Blynk)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- IR Sensor
- Flame Sensor
- Inductive Metal Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Arduino IDE (Embedded C/C++)
- Blynk IoT Cloud Platform

## 📷 Images
(Add circuit diagram or block diagram if available)

## 📂 Code Modules
- `main_code.ino` – handles sensor logic and motor control
- Blynk alert setup integrated with ESP8266WiFi
- Calibration and testing routines for all sensors

## 📊 Live Data
Real-time values of sensor data sent to Blynk app dashboard via WiFi.
